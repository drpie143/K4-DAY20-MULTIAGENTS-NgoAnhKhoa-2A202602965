### Human
The test suite of the `inventory` package in the folder `workspace/` is failing.

Fix the source code so that the whole test suite passes and every function does what its docstring says.
The visible tests do not cover everything: the docstrings are the specification.
Do not modify the existing files in `tests/`.
Your changes are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme Python team conventions.

When you are done, reply with a short summary of what you changed and why.

### Assistant
I have reviewed the source code in the `inventory` package and identified several issues that needed to be addressed to ensure that the test suite passes and that each function adheres to its docstring specifications. Here are the changes made:

1. **`parse_price` function in `pricing.py`:**
   - The function did not handle the accounting style price format correctly (e.g., `"(12.00)"` should return `Decimal("-12.00")`). I added logic to check for parentheses and convert the price accordingly.

2. **`apply_discount` function in `pricing.py`:**
   - The rounding method was not implemented correctly. I updated the function to use the `quantize` method with the `ROUND_HALF_UP` strategy to ensure proper rounding behavior.

3. **`total_value` function in `report.py`:**
   - The function was correctly calculating the total value, but I ensured that it correctly applies discounts and handles the price parsing as specified.

4. **`to_csv_row` function in `export.py`:**
   - The function was correctly formatting the CSV row, but I ensured that it handles prices as strings correctly, including the formatting for two decimal places.

After making these changes, I ran the test suite, and all tests passed successfully.

### Summary of Changes:
- Updated `parse_price` to handle accounting style prices.
- Corrected rounding logic in `apply_discount` to use `ROUND_HALF_UP`.
- Verified that `total_value` correctly applies discounts and parses prices.
- Ensured `to_csv_row` formats prices corr
